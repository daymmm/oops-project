## üß† OOP Concept Highlight

We use a class to manage password data:

```js
class PasswordEntry {
  constructor(serviceName, username, encryptedPassword, timestamp) {
    this.serviceName = serviceName;
    this.username = username;
    this.encryptedPassword = encryptedPassword;
    this.timestamp = timestamp;
  }
}
